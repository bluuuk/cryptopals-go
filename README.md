# cryptopals-go

Simple side project to learn go and solve all [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) problems.

## Set 1

This was done when I had no go experience. If I redo it, I would keep attention to _dependency injection_ where the actual encryption block can be exchanged to something else in case _AES_ is broken at one point.

## Set 2

After leaving cryptopals for some time, I decided to work on it again.
